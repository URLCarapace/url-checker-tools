## About WICAR Test Sites

WICAR (Web EICAR) provides the web equivalent of EICAR test files:
- **Safe for Testing**: Non-destructive malware samples designed for security testing
- **Industry Standard**: Widely used by security professionals
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Various types of malicious content (exploits, miners, etc.)
- **API Integration**: Recognized by major threat intelligence providers

## Usage Notes

- Scripts use `--robot` mode for comprehensive provider coverage
- Results include MISP event creation (if configured)
- Session logs are automatically generated in `data/logs/sessions/`
- SSL warnings for MISP localhost connections are expected
- Whalebone errors are expected (requires specific API configuration)

## Integration with Test Suite

These URLs are also used in the automated test suite:
```bash
# Test provider connectivity with malicious detection
pytest tests/test_provider_discovery.py::TestProviderDiscovery::test_provider_malicious_detection_with_test_sites -v
```

This ensures both manual testing and automated testing use the same validated URLs.
