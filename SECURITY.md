# Security and vulnerability disclosure policy

Security is an important concern for URLChecker-tools so we welcome responsible reports of vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- The URLChecker-tools source code and default configuration shipped in the public repositories.
- Supporting documentation and example configuration files.

It does **not** cover specific deployments operated by third parties; in these case, please refer to the considered stakeholders.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in URLChecker-tools, please contact:

- **Primary contact:** cedric.renzi@restena.lu
- **Suggested subject line:** `Security issue in URLChecker-tools`

Whenever possible, please encrypt your message using the following GnuPG key:

- **Fingerprint:** `4741 F2E1 56DC E719 89A7 4BAD 44AC 149A B8F6 2937`

You can obtain the corresponding public key from standard key servers.

- **Other contact:** https://restena.lu/fr/csirt

### What to include

To help us understand and reproduce the issue, please include, where available:

- A short description of the issue and its potential impact.
- The affected component, file or feature.
- Steps to reproduce (a minimal proof-of-concept, if possible).
- Relevant logs, configuration details or environment notes (redacted if needed).
- Whether the issue has already been disclosed elsewhere.

Please **do not** share detailed vulnerability information in public GitHub issues, pull requests, forums or mailing lists before we have had a chance to assess the report.

## Our approach

URLChecker-tools is developed and maintained on a best-effort basis:

- We will review reasonable security reports as soon as we can.
- Where an issue is confirmed, we will work towards an appropriate fix or mitigation.
- We may contact you for clarification and, if you agree, to credit you in release notes.

We do **not** guarantee that vulnerabilities will be fixed within a specific timeframe, but security issues are treated with higher priority than ordinary feature requests.

## Responsible disclosure

When handling security reports, we kindly ask that you:

- Give us a reasonable opportunity to investigate and address the vulnerability before public disclosure.
- Avoid accessing, altering or deleting data that does not belong to you.
- Avoid actions that could degrade the availability or integrity of services for others (for example, no denial-of-service testing against live systems).

In return, we will treat your report seriously and in good faith, and we will not pursue legal action against good-faith security research that respects these boundaries and complies with applicable law.
